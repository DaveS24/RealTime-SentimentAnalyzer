# RealTime-SentimentAnalyzer

RealTime-SentimentAnalyzer aims to develop a sentiment analysis model capable of classifying text into five categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive. The project utilizes the Stanford SentimentTreebank dataset and involves building and evaluating multiple models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and potentially other architectures. The initial focus is on achieving accurate sentiment prediction before integrating real-time text input for live sentiment analysis.
